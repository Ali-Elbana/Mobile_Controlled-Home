# Mobile_Controlled-Home

The system allows controlling the home by mobile phone application through Bluetooth.
Three subsystems are implemented:

1-Safety door that could be opened by the mobile application by entering user name and password.

2-light on/off that could be controlled also by the mobile phone. The system supports 10 users with different names and password.

3-Fan(DC Motor) on/off that could be controlled also by the mobile phone.

In case of entering the name of the password 3 times wrong, the system should give alarm.
